# Namaste Node.js – Tinder Dev Backend 🚀

A **full-stack web application** built while learning **Node.js** through **Namaste Node.js by Akshay Saini**.

This project is inspired by a **Tinder-like developer matching platform**, where developers can discover, connect, and interact with each other.

The application includes:
- A **React-based frontend** for user interaction
- A **Node.js + Express backend** for APIs and business logic
- A **MongoDB database** for persistent storage

This project focuses on **real-world full-stack architecture**, clean APIs, authentication, and scalable design — not just UI screenshots.

## 🧠 What I Learned from This Project

This project is not about building a toy app. It is about understanding how real backend systems work.

Key learnings:
- How Node.js actually works (event loop, async I/O)
- How Express handles requests and middleware
- Designing REST APIs properly
- Authentication & authorization
- Database schema design
- Writing clean, maintainable backend code
